This software is used to compare two videos of people practicing the same strategy in a sport. One of the videos is a professional athlete while the other is an amateur trying to improve.
Our software would make skeletons of both people and compare the joints/vectors which would allow us to give feedback to the user on how they can improve their form to become similar to one of an athletes.

## Use
```
python3 main.py
```
-------

#### Libraries used
This project is heavily based on the OpenPose library to make the skeleton of our users. We also use some front-end libraries for our react website
